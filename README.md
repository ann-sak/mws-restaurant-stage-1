## Running the page

1. In order to view the page in your browser, you have to download the project.

2. Then you have to run the server. You can use e.g. Python. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. For Python 3.x, you can use `py -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software. If you have port 8000 in use, you can change it in `js/dbhelper.js` file.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
